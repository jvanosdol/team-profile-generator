## Description

This project demonstrates knowledge of generating custom HTML files based on user input. The initial HTML is blank except for a header element. As the user answers the prompts, the answers are then saved and are built into the HTML file. When the user is finished with prompts, the HTML file will finish generating and will display all of the user generated input. The user input will be displayed in cards within the main page. The HTML file is reset each time the program is run. 

The goal of the project is to generate a web page that displays a 'team' that the user creates. The user must add a manager and then has the option to add any number of interns or engineers. Based on the type of employee that is being added, the user will be prompted to add specific data about the employee.
